Fix for the Call of Duty 4 Linux Lan Server
============
Architecture:
cod4_fix_proxy.py listens for Cod4 Client Messages and forwards them to cod4_fix_server.py.
cod4_fix_server.py sends the response from Cod4 Server to the client.

cod4_fix_server.py must run on the same server as the co4 dedicated server
